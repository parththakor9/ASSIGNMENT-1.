            You're the light, you're the night<br>
            You're the color of my blood<br>
            You're the cure, you're the pain<br>
            You're the only thing I wanna touch<br>
            Never knew that it could mean so much, so much<br>
            You're the fear, I don't care<br>
            'Cause I've never been so high<br>
            Follow me through the dark<br>
            Let me take you past our satellites<br>
            You can see the world you brought to life, to life<br>
            So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do<br>
            Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            Fading in, fading out<br>
            On the edge of paradise<br>
            Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find<br>
            Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire<br>
            Yeah, I'll let you set the pace<br>
            'Cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
            My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do<br>
            Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (ye-yeah)<br>
            Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            I'll let you set the pace<br>
            'Cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
            My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (ye-yeah)<br>
            Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do<br>
            What are you waiting for?<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)<br>
            Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (whoa)<br>
            Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do (ah)<br>
            What are you waiting for?
